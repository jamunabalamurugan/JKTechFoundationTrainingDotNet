           /* dynamic type:
▪ The dynamic type indicates that use of the variable and references to its members bypass compiletime type checking.
▪ Instead, these operations are resolved at run time.
▪ Type dynamic behaves like type object in most circumstances. 
▪ Any non-null expression can be converted to the dynamic type. 
▪ The dynamic type differs from object in that operations that contain expressions of type dynamic are
not resolved or type checked by the compiler.
▪ The compiler packages together information about the operation, and that information is later used
to evaluate the operation at run time.
▪ As part of the process, variables of type dynamic are compiled into variables of type object.
Therefore, type dynamic exists only at compile time, not at run time.*/
